### Hi there, I'm Khalid! 👋🏾

I'm a fullstack web developer, aspiring game developer and comic book nerd. Thanks for checking out my GitHub page! Here are a couple of things about me:

 - :office: I work with Gadget, a small Ottawa based startup!
 - :sunglasses: I'm currently learning the Unity and Unreal game engines 
 - :iphone: Really interested in finding new ways to create more immersive experiences on the web, especially for education!
